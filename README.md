# Infection
A 2D zombie apocalypse shooting game that I created using Java, in 2017. This game can be can played on my website: http://www.anmolnagpal.ca/content/Infection

Ever since I was younger, I had always dreamed about creating a 2-dimensional shooter with an apolcalypic scenario. Hence, the ambition behind creating this application was to fulfill my personal dream, while also honing my programming and developmental skills.

Somee of challenges I faced during the creation of this project was collision detection, animations and random location of enemy spawning - all of which I was able to figure out.

As stated above, this game was created in 2017, and so it is quite painful to peak through my old code - after all, I suppose this is a good thing, as it shows how much I have improved. If I was to redo this project all over again, I would truly follow a MVC design pattern to keep things as simple as possible.
