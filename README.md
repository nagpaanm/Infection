# Infection
Infection is a 2D "birds-eye-view" shooting game that I developed using Java. 

The theme of the game is that of a zombie apocalpyse. You start off with a handgun and must eliminate all zombies that bull-rush towards you. As you progress, more and more zombies will spawn, and different kinds of zombies may appear. You will also have the opportunity to pick up power-ups - such as body armor, and more weaponry - such as grenades.

Controls:
  - Movement: (W (up), A (left), S (down), D (right))
  - shoot: left-click
  - throw grenade: right-click


Some of the challenges that I faced during the development of this project was collision detection, spontaneous animations, and having zombies spawn randomly in a 'correct' boundary range. These challenges served as an excellnt learning experience for me.
